Welcome to my final project for COMM 313 in Spring 2021:

# A Shift In Gratitude: How the Pandemic Changed What and How We Are Grateful.

Using Twitter data from Thanksgiving 2019 and 2020, I will look at expressions of gratitude to discern whether people are more grateful for their loved ones (family/friends) and health during the pandemic in 2020 compared to before the pandemic in 2019. My research question is **Are people more grateful for loved ones and health on Thanksgiving 2020 compared to Thanksgiving 2019?**. 

The following folders in this project are organized as follows:

- data: where you will find the data in folders by the raw data vs. cleaned data (and then by year) for the data I scraped from Twitter. 

- data_analysis: where you will find my 5 analysis notebooks where I test my hypothesis, as well as a functions notebook.

- final_data_story: where you will find my final data story in the form of a blog post to take my reader through a series of insights derived from the Twitter data.

- presentation: where you will find a notebook slides deck with the presentation I gave to the class (via Zoom recording) that discusses my research topic.
