## Blog post of your data story for COMM313 Final Project

In this folder, I have one notebook with the data story I have chosen to communicate my findings in the form of a blog post. I have situated my analysis in the struggles of the last year to test my hypothesis whether people are more grateful for friends/family and the contexts in which people talk about what they are grateful for.  I then venture into a separate but related analysis around how this relates to the different experiences of the last two years in how people refer to year, 2019, and 2020. 

Enjoy!
