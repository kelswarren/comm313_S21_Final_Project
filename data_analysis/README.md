## Data analysis notebooks for COMM313 Final Project

In the following notebooks I conduct my analysis for this project:

- `Analysis_1_Data_Retreival_Cleaning.ipynb`: In this notebook, I scrape Twitter for the queries I am looking for to get 15k tweets for Thanksgiving 2019 and 2020. I also extract the text data from the tweets, put the tweets into a two new json files based on the two years, and check the data directives. 

- `Analysis_2_Freq_Keyness.ipynb`: In this notebook, I go through both of the corpora, and look overall at frequency lists and keyness to compare generally across years. This helps me figure out which dynamics I should look closely at for the testing of my hypothesis. 

- `Analysis_3_Loved_Ones.ipynb`: In this notebook, I look at the frequency, KWIC, and keyness of collocates of the topic of loved ones to test my hypothesis.

- `Analysis_4_Health.ipynb`: In this notebook, I look at the frequency, KWIC, and keyness of collocates of the topic of health to test my hypothesis.

- `Analysis_5_Beyond_My_Hypothesis.ipynb`: In this notebook, I look at PoS tagging to look at how the Tweets are describing the world differently and at the collocates/keyness around mentions of the year itself to see how people feel about the year in review. This helps explore a separate but related topic to my hypothesis around how the world has changed and how people respond to it.

- `functions.ipynb`: In this notebook, I have saved all the functions and packages I need to carry out my analysis.
